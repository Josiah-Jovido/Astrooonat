I worked with a content-based recommendation system that leverages the features and attributes about a song. The Dataset used in the data preparation was gotten from Kaggle as i had no prior user data. I used **cosine similarity** for generating recommendations. Cosine similarity measures the similarity between two vectors of an inner product space. It is measured by the cosine of the angle between two vectors and determines whether two vectors are pointing in roughly the same direction. It is a metric used to measure how similar the documents are irrespective of their size, for this case i applied it to songs.
